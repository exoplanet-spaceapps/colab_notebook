## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report documents the current state of Google Colab's runtime environment as of October 2025, including Python version, pre-installed package versions, breaking changes, best practices, and new features introduced throughout 2025.

---

## 1. Python Runtime Version

### Current Version: **Python 3.12**

- **Upgrade Date:** July 28, 2025
- **Previous Version:** Python 3.10
- **Reason for Upgrade:** Alignment with Python's cadence of final regular bug fix releases

### Key Details:
- Python 3.12 is now the default runtime for all new Colab notebooks
- **Torch packages** upgraded to **2.8.0** (required for Python 3.12 compatibility as torch-xla<2.8 does not support Python 3.12)
- Fallback runtime to Python 3.11 was available temporarily until early September 2025

### Code to Verify Python Version:
```python
import sys
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Version info: {sys.version_info}")
```

---

## 2. Pre-installed Package Versions

### 2.1 NumPy

**Version:** `2.0.2`

- **Release Date:** June 2024
- **Colab Upgrade Date:** March 2025
- **Significance:** First major release since 2006

#### Major Changes:
- **ABI Break:** Binary compatibility broken with NumPy 1.x
- **Type Promotion Changes:** Scalar precision now preserved consistently
  - Example: `np.float32(3) + 3.` now returns `float32` (previously returned `float64`)
- **Namespace Reorganization:**
  - ~100 members deprecated/removed/moved from main `np` namespace
  - `np.core` is now private (`np._core`)
  - `np.lib` significantly reduced
- **Automated Migration:** Use Ruff rule `NPY201` for automatic code updates

#### Migration Resources:
- Official Migration Guide: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html
- Breaking changes can be auto-detected and fixed using Ruff linter

#### Code to Check Version:
```python
import numpy as np
print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
```

---

### 2.2 Pandas

**Version:** `2.2.2`

- **Release Date:** January 2024 (upgraded to 2.2.2 in April 2024)
- **NumPy 2.0 Compatibility:** ‚úÖ Fully compatible

#### Major Deprecations:
1. **Chained Assignment** - Deprecated in preparation for Copy-on-Write (CoW) in pandas 3.0
2. **Automatic Downcasting** - No longer automatically downcasts object dtype results
3. **Specific Function Deprecations:**
   - `DataFrameGroupBy.fillna()` / `SeriesGroupBy.fillna()` ‚Üí Use `ffill()`, `bfill()` or `DataFrame.fillna()`
   - `DateOffset.is_anchored()` ‚Üí Use `obj.n == 1`
   - `Series.ravel()` ‚Üí Underlying array is already 1D
   - `Index.format()` ‚Üí Use `index.astype(str)` or `index.map(formatter)`

#### Upcoming Changes (Pandas 3.0 - Expected 2025):
- **Copy-on-Write (CoW)** will be enforced
- **String dtype changes** - pandas will infer string columns using Arrow-backed string type
- Recommendation: Upgrade to pandas 2.3 first to get deprecation warnings

#### Code to Check Version:
```python
import pandas as pd
print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
```

---

### 2.3 Scikit-learn

**Version:** `1.5.0+` (pre-installed)

- **Latest Available:** 1.7.2 (September 2025)
- **NumPy 2.0 Support:** ‚úÖ Version 1.5.0+ includes support
- **Recommendation:** May want to manually upgrade for latest features

#### Code to Check and Upgrade:
```python
import sklearn
print(f"Scikit-learn version: {sklearn.__version__}")

# To upgrade to latest version:
# !pip install scikit-learn --upgrade
```

---

### 2.4 Matplotlib

**Status:** Pre-installed (exact version varies)

- Check version with: `import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)`
- Update if needed: `!pip install matplotlib --upgrade`

---

### 2.5 Seaborn

**Status:** Pre-installed (exact version varies)

- Check version with: `import seaborn; print(seaborn.__version__)`
- Update if needed: `!pip install seaborn --upgrade`

---

## 3. Breaking Changes & Compatibility Warnings

### 3.1 NumPy 2.0 Breaking Changes

#### Critical Changes:
1. **Namespace Cleanup**
   - Many functions moved from `np.lib.*` to main namespace
   - `np.core` is now private (`np._core`)
   - If you get `AttributeError` from `np.lib`, try main `np` namespace

2. **Type Promotion**
   - Scalar precision is preserved
   - May affect calculations expecting automatic upcasting

3. **Removed/Deprecated Functions**
   - Approximately 100 members affected
   - Use Ruff linter with NPY201 rule for automated migration

#### Migration Strategy:
```python
# Before (NumPy 1.x)
result = np.float32(3) + 3.  # Returns float64

# After (NumPy 2.0)
result = np.float32(3) + 3.  # Returns float32
```

---

### 3.2 Pandas 2.2 Breaking Changes

#### Deprecated Patterns:
```python
# ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Chained assignment
df[df['A'] > 0]['B'] = value

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use .loc
df.loc[df['A'] > 0, 'B'] = value

# ‚ùå DEPRECATED: GroupBy.fillna()
grouped.fillna(0)

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use ffill/bfill or DataFrame.fillna
df.groupby('key').ffill()
# OR
df.fillna(0).groupby('key')

# ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Series.ravel()
series.ravel()

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use .to_numpy() or .values
series.to_numpy()
```

---

## 4. File Upload Best Practices for 2025

### 4.1 Recommended Upload Methods (Priority Order)

#### ü•á Method 1: Google Drive Mount (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why:** Persistent storage, survives session timeouts, no re-upload needed

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Access files
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/data/dataset.csv')
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PERFORMANCE TIP:**
- **DO NOT** train models on data in mounted Google Drive (very slow)
- **ALWAYS** copy data to local storage first (10x faster)

```python
# Copy from Drive to local for faster access
!cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/data /content/local_data

# Now train on local data
df = pd.read_csv('/content/local_data/dataset.csv')
```

---

#### ü•à Method 2: wget for External URLs (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why:** Faster than manual upload, backend downloads directly

```python
# Download from URL
!wget https://example.com/dataset.csv

# Download and rename
!wget https://example.com/dataset.csv -O my_dataset.csv

# Download from GitHub raw file
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/data.csv
```

---

#### ü•â Method 3: Direct UI Upload (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why:** Simple for small files, but lost on disconnect

- Use the file explorer panel in Colab
- Click upload button
- **Limitation:** Chrome only, Firefox/Safari not supported
- **Warning:** Files lost on session timeout

---

#### Method 4: Python Upload Function (LOW PRIORITY)
**Why:** Programmatic but slow

```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

# Access uploaded file
import pandas as pd
import io
for filename in uploaded.keys():
    df = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(uploaded[filename]))
```

---

### 4.2 Colab Storage Limitations

- **Idle Timeout:** 90 minutes
- **Absolute Timeout:** 12 hours
- **Total Disk Space:** 108 GB
- **Available to User:** 77 GB
- **Free Google Drive:** 15 GB

---

### 4.3 Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Large Datasets:** Upload zip file to Google Drive, then unzip in Colab
```python
!unzip /content/drive/MyDrive/large_dataset.zip -d /content/data
```

2. **Many Small Files:** Create archives instead of uploading individually
   - Example: 100 archives of 1000 images each (not 100,000 individual files)

3. **Training Performance:** ALWAYS copy from Drive to local before training
```python
# ‚ùå SLOW: Training on Drive-mounted data
model.fit(drive_data)

# ‚úÖ FAST: Copy to local first
!cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/training_data /content/local_data
model.fit(local_data)  # 10x faster
```

## 7. Recommended Practices for October 2025

### 7.1 Package Management

```python
# Check versions first
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
print(f"NumPy: {np.__version__}, Pandas: {pd.__version__}")

# Upgrade if needed (uncomment to run)
# !pip install numpy --upgrade
# !pip install pandas --upgrade
# !pip install scikit-learn --upgrade
```

### 7.2 File Handling

```python
# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Mount Google Drive for persistence
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Copy to local before intensive operations
!cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/data /content/data

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use wget for external files
!wget https://example.com/data.csv
```

### 7.3 Code Compatibility

```python
# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use .loc for assignments (pandas 2.2+)
df.loc[df['A'] > 0, 'B'] = value

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Be explicit with dtypes
df['column'] = df['column'].astype('float32')

# ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Use main numpy namespace
import numpy as np
# Not np.core.* or np.lib.*
```
