## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current State
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No critical issues detected
- ✅ No data quality problems found

### Observations
1. **Feature-Label Mismatch:** Features file has 1,866 rows while labels file has 8,054 rows
   - **Impact:** Tests use only the first 1,000 matching samples
   - **Recommendation:** Investigate and align the two datasets

2. **Class Imbalance:** CONFIRMED class dominates (~71%)
   - **Impact:** Model may be biased toward CONFIRMED predictions
   - **Recommendation:** Consider using class weights or resampling techniques

3. **Test Sample Size:** Tests use 1,000 samples for performance
   - **Impact:** Full dataset (8,054) not tested
   - **Recommendation:** Run full-scale validation on complete dataset

### ⚠️ Recommendations Before Production
1. **Align feature and label datasets** - Investigate row count mismatch

3. **Address class imbalance** - Implement balancing strategy if needed
4. **Add logging** - Implement comprehensive logging for production monitoring
5. **Add data validation** - Check for outliers, anomalies in features
6. **Version control** - Track data versions alongside code

- One-hot encoding with proper binary representation
- Data merging without loss
- Reproducible random shuffling
- Stratified train-test split with exact 3:1 ratio
- Output shape validation
